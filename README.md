Cargo plugin for generating a listing of all of the crates used by a root crate, and the the terms under which they are licensed.

![license](media/license.png)

You can view the full license [here](media/license.html)

## Getting started:

### Installing

```
cargo install cargo-about
```

### Generating `license.html` for `cargo-about`

```bash
cd cargo-about
cargo about generate about.hbs > license.html
```

### Generating license information for your own project

Create an `about.toml` file in the root of your project

```toml
# Add licenses that you accept for your project
accepted = [
    "Apache-2.0",
    "MIT",
]
```

`cargo-about` uses [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to generate license information. An easy way to get started is to use the [about.hbs](about.hbs) from `cargo-about`


Generate the license information with `cargo about generate about.hbs > license.html`

### Adding additional licenses to `about.toml`

Not all licenses are placed in seperate licnese files. Those files can be explicity added like this:

```toml
[[physx-sys.additional]]
root = "PhysX"
license = "BSD-3-Clause"
license-file = "PhysX/README.md"
license-start = 3
license-end = 28
```

### Ignoring specific licenses in `about.toml`

Sometimes libraries include licenses for example code that you don't want to use. You can ignore those licenses with:
```toml
[[imgui-sys.ignore]]
license = "Zlib"
license-file = "third-party/cimgui/imgui/examples/libs/glfw/COPYING.txt"
```

## FAQ

### Unable to satisfy the following licenses

```bash
[ERROR] Crate 'aho-corasick': Unable to satisfy [Unlicense OR MIT], with the following accepted licenses [Apache-2.0]
```

In this case you are missing either `MIT` or `Unlicense` as an `accepted` license in your `about.toml`
