Cargo plugin for generating a listing of all of the crates used by a root crate, and the terms under which they are licensed.

## Getting started:

### Installing

```
cargo install cargo-about
```

### Generate license information for your own project

```bash
# Generates `about.toml` and `about.hbs` in your cargo project
cargo about init
# Generate the license information with
cargo about generate about.hbs > license.html
```

## `about.toml`

### `[accepted]`

Priority list of all the accepted licenses for a project. `cargo-about` will try to satisfy the licenses in the order that they are declared in this list.

```toml
accepted = [
    "Apache-2.0",
    "MIT",
]
```
### `[[DEPDENDENCY.additional]]`
* `root` Name of the root folder
* `license` Name of the license. Has to be parsable from SPDX, see https://spdx.org/licenses/
* `license-file` The path to the license file where the license is specified
* `license-start` The starting line number of the license in the specified license file
* `license-end` The ending line number of the license in the specified license file


```toml
# Example
[[physx-sys.additional]]
root = "PhysX"
license = "BSD-3-Clause"
license-file = "PhysX/README.md"
license-start = 3
license-end = 28
```

### `[[DEPDENDENCY.ignore]]`
Sometimes libraries include licenses for example code that you don't want to use.

* `license` Name of the license that you want to ingore. Has to be parsable from SPDX, see https://spdx.org/licenses/
* `license-file` The path to the license file where the license is specified

```toml
# Example
[[imgui-sys.ignore]]
license = "Zlib"
license-file = "third-party/cimgui/imgui/examples/libs/glfw/COPYING.txt"
```

## `about.hbs`
See [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com)

* `licenses` A list of `License`

* `count` The number of times the license is used
* `name` The name of the license
* `id` The `id` of the license

#### `License`
* `name` The full name of the license
* `id` The SPDX identifier
* `text` The license text
* `source_path` The path of the license
* `used_by` A list of `UsedBy`

#### `UsedBy`

* `path` Optional path of the depndency that is being used by the license

#### Example

## FAQ

### Unable to satisfy the following licenses

```bash
[ERROR] Crate 'aho-corasick': Unable to satisfy [Unlicense OR MIT], with the following accepted licenses [Apache-2.0]
```

In this case you are missing either `MIT` or `Unlicense` as an `accepted` license in your `about.toml`
